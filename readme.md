## Tools Needed 
- Process Hacker - to view running processes & modules.
- DebugView - to view debugging output from our driver.
- WinObj - to view kernel space objects.
- PEInternals - to statically view PE files.
- WERSetup - to set up Windows Error Reporting to catch user-mode process crashes.
- WinAPI Search - to check Imports/Exports from PE files and to search for error codes.
- Driver Loader/Unloaded - to register, start, stop and unregister our driver.

Kernel32.dll is a core Windows system file responsible for managing memory, input/output operations, and interrupts. It provides essential functions for processes and threads, file handling, and hardware abstraction. This dynamic link library is crucial for the execution of many system-level operations in the Windows operating system. \

Kernel32.dll contains numerous essential functions for system operations. Some examples include: \
- CreateFile: Opens or creates a file or I/O device.
- ReadFile: Reads data from a file or I/O device.
- WriteFile: Writes data to a file or I/O device.
- GetLastError: Retrieves the last error code generated by a function.
- VirtualAlloc: Reserves or commits a region of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.


## What is a Driver?
- A driver is a software component that allows the operating system and a device to communicate with each other. Drivers are typically hardware-specific and operating-system-specific.
Types of Drivers:
- Kernel-mode drivers: Run in the operating system's kernel space and have high privileges. These are often used for hardware drivers.
- User-mode drivers: Run in user space and have limited privileges. These are generally easier and safer to develop.
